# Gips.vim
_This plugin is only for Japanese NOW._   

We vimmer, when moving cursor, is not allowed to use arrow key. We should use hjkl keys.
This plugin is restricted to use arrow keys. If you use it, you are scolded by vim on status line.

## install
> Bundle 'modsound/gips-vim.git'

## config
  You can make vim into speaking(but on statusline now) as you like, if you set a variable where your textfile separated by newlines is.

> let g:gips_reading_txt = '$HOME/.vim/bundle/gips-vim/autoload/dict/tsundere.txt'

##THANKS!!
I conceived the idea of this plugin at yokohama.vim.
@thinca's advice made my script fit for practical use.  
The random numbers code depends on @osyo-manga.
