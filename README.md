# Gips.vim
_This plugin is only for Japanese NOW._   
But if you set a text separated by newlines 'g:gips_reading_txt', vim would say it.

We vimmer, when moving cursor, is not allowed to use arrow key. We should use hjkl keys.
This plugin is restricted to use arrow keys. If you use it, you are scolded by vim via status line.

##THANKS!!
I conceived the idea of this plugin at yokohama.vim.
@thinca's advice made my script fit for practical use.  
The random numbers code depends on @osyo-manga.
